					<h3><a href="#">What would you like this facility to do differently</a></h3>
					<ul id='categorie1'>
						<li id='#1'>
							Have a concrete cage so beam flux and field of view can be increased as much as possible.
						</li>
						<li id='#2'>	
							I hope the beam line can be equipped with heating and in situ mechanical loading capabilities.
						</li>
						<li id='#4'>
							Nothing!
						</li>
						<li id='#3'>
							Maybe have a water fountain somewhere in the area.
						</li>
						<li id='#4'>
							Longer facility operations, more beam time availability.
						</li>
						<li id='#4'>
							Have more beam time available to users
						</li>
						<li id='#4'>
							It would be great to have many meetings with other users to share research ideas.
						</li>
						<li id='#5'>
							This is a prototype instrument, so clearly it cannot be expected to be 
							very versatile, and these comments are more about what could be improved in future. 
							The imaging beamline needs better sample positioning stages. At present it is very
							 limiting on sample dimensions, given it's obvious potential for moderate sized samples. 
							 There is an obvious need for links to (and general instructions for) suitable software
							  tools for image reconstruction and analysis for Users. Accessing the HFIR server to access 
							  the data took many steps for myself and for my Sandia collaborator - this should have been 
							  more straightforward.
						</li>
						<li id='#4'>
							 It was great.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3><a href="#">General Comments</a></h3>
					<ul id='categorie2'>
						<li id="#1">
							The only reason I mark dissatisfied on fraction that the facility operates is because there
							 is a high demand for neutron imaging and few days provided for imaging. However,
							  my main project in developing coded source imaging is beginning to be considered 
							  development and may help relieve some stress placed on user imaging time needs.
						</li>
						<li id="#2">
							Of course I would like more access to the beam line, so a higher fraction of the year 
							in operation would help that.
						</li>
						<li id="#3">
							Obviously I would prefer to see HFIR operating more often, but I fully understand the budgetary constraints.
						</li>
						<li id="#4">
							 The downtime was frustrating however it was caused by a power outage which was clearly
							  outside the control of the staff we were working with.
						</li>
						<li id="#4">
							 It is a prototype, so I don't expect flawless operation. However, I would like to see a 
							 couple of upgrades to improve the performance of the instrument and simplify data reduction. 
							 A sample environment providing precise temperature control would be very useful.
						</li>

					<h3><a href="#">What can we do to facilitate the success of your experiments and improve your
						 experience at the High Flux Isotope Reactor?</a></h3>
					<ul id='categorie4'>
						<li id='#1'>
							Expand flux and field of view.
						</li>
						<li id='#1'>
							More time...
						</li>
						<li id='#1'>
							 I had a great experience at HFIR and would not like to see anything changed.
						</li>
						<li id='#1'>
							Keep on doing a great job!!! Thanks!!!
						</li>
						<li id='#1'>
							 I received only one day of beam time in 2011. More beam time allowance can definitely improve my experiment.
						</li>
						<li id='#1'>
							None.
						</li>
					<li id='#1'>
						Good experience.
						</li>
					<li id='#1'>
						  Provide more support to the beam line scientist in charge so that to closely work with users to 
						  make changes in experiments, support analysis during data collection and innovate new 
						  methods while actually doing the work
						</li>
					<li id='#1'>
						 Would it be possible to provide D2O and other basic chemicals needed for the experiments?
						</li>
					<li id='#1'>
						It was great.
