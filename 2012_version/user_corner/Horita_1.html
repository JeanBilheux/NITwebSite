				<td>Research application(s):</td><td>Understanding fluid-rock interactions under subsurface conditions, including several DOE-relevant issues such as geologic CO2 sequestration, fluid migration in salt deposits, and contaminant migration in the vadose zone.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Why neutrons:</td><td>Neutron imaging is particularly useful for visualizing and understanding the fluid-rock interactions discussed above, because of its sensitivity to water and other natural fluids, and of deep penetration into porous geologic media.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Goal:</td><td>In collaboration with UT Knoxville and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, we have initiated a novel neutron imaging project for in-situ observation and monitoring of fluids (water, CO2) in geologic porous media at ambient conditions. We plan to expand to high-pressure and high-temperature conditions, relevant to deep subsurface environments.'</td>
